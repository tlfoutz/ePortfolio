            <h2>Creator and Developer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My passion lies in creating. I put the all the effort I can into what I create, because it reflects upon who I am.</li>
                <li>It is a rare instance where I consider a project to be completely finished. There is always something that can be improved, but I don't let that prevent me from seeing a project to its end.</li>
                <li>Developing programs and software for other people is an exciting challenge to me. I make sure I keep an open mind when other communicate their ideas and thoughts so I may meet and, hopefully, exceed their expections.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Solution Explorer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a saying: "There is more than one way to skin a cat." While this is applicable to software engineering, some methods are better than others, given the circumstance. I believe to be worth the effor to take the time to find best path for the situation.</li>
                <li>Keeping calm has always benefited me when confronted with difficult problems. I have developed multiple practices for maintaining cool-headed, for both myself and encouraging others to do so as well, in high stress level occasions.</li>
                <li>I find myself playing the devil's advocate when stuck on a problem. In many cases, what I think I know is incorrect, and by challenging myself to determine how I know what I know, I can find where I was wrong.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Seeker of Knowledge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I consider myself a perpetual student; not because of how long I have been one, but because I will never stop studying new topics. Whether it be for a do-it-yourself project or a master's degree, I will be a life-long learner.</li>
                <li>Currently, I am a junior at BYU-Idaho studying Software Engineering with a 3.96 GPA.</li>
                <li>There is value in studying subjects of all types. Quite often, I come across correlations I do not expect, and then my overall understanding increases.</li>
