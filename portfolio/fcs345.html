            <h2>Project: Final Design</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="columns">
                    <p><b>Objectives:</b> Demonstrate skill in fashion design, pattern making, and advanced sewing construction by creating and fabricating garments of original design without use of any commercial patterns and meeting BYUI dress standards.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="columns">
                    <p><b>Learning:</b> the project was multi-level and couple multiple weeks to complete. A sketch detailing the design first needed to be approved. After that, fabric choices were made. A timeline was then established to determine when important steps of constructing the garments were to be completed. Following that, the necessary patterns, using the slopers were made for every part of the garment. With those patterns, the garments were constructed, including fittings and alterations.</p>
                    <p>The shirt is a four way stretch knit; regular collar with placket; double needle finish for sleeves and hem. It was the first time I ever made a placket, and relied heavily on directions from an online blog.</p>
                    <p>The overalls are a stretch denim (75% cotton, 23% polyester, 2% elastane). 1" domed mushroom buttons were used for the shoulder straps to the front. Topstitching was used on most seams and hems. The side pockets were made longer than regular pockets to hold tools like screwdrivers or hammers.
