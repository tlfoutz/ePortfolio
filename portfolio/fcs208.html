                        <br><br>What is the fad? Where did this fashion fad originate? Provide reasons for it not lasting.
                        <br><br>Where did this fashion classic originate? Why do you think it has endured?

                    <p><b>Learning:</b> Before completing this assignment, I lacked the knowledge to determine what constituted a fad.

                </div>
                <div class="columns">
                    <p><b>Learning:</b> I discussed the results of the burn lab with my mother. She had a question about the differences in the odors of burning natural and synthetic fibers. In addition to the descriptions from the chart, I summarized that, in general, natural fibers gave of the smell of either paper or hair, and had a more organic smell to them, as opposed to the strong chemical smells of synthetic fibers. After explaining the residual material after burning, my mother mentioned played a huge part in her decision of fabric for the clothing she made for her children. The synthetic types were avoided to lessen the harm in the case of the clothing catching fire.</p>
                    <p>This burn test seemed to only generally cover a few of the more popular type of fabrics, and did not go in-depth into blended fabrics. I could try doing an online search to see if anybody has written a more in-depth fabric burning guide.</p>

                    <p><b>Learning:</b> Creating the weaves using paper allowed me see how it affects the characteristics of the fabric. For example, the plain weave had the highest structural integrity, as the fibers wrapped around each other at a higher frequency. And the satin weave, with its fibers being less intertwined, had a greater degree of drapability. But other factors, such as thread count, play a part in determining overall properties.</p>
